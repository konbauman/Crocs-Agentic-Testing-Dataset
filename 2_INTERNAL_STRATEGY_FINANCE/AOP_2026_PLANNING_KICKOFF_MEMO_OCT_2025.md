TO: All VPs, Brand & Operations FROM: Andrew Rees, CEO DATE: October 1, 2025 SUBJECT: 2026 Annual Operating Plan (AOP) Kickoff

Team,

We are officially kicking off the 2026 AOP cycle.

Our planning will be built on the "Fortress Crocs" strategy that has served us well. The core Crocs brand continues to show resilience, especially internationally, and we will fund its continued growth.

The HEYDUDE brand has seen softness in the wholesale channel this year, as noted in our Q1 and Q2 calls. The 2026 AOP will focus on right-sizing this channel and re-igniting DTC growth.

Operations will present their initial mitigation scenarios for the new tariff structures  so we can build a resilient COGS model.   

Finance will be in touch with all department heads for initial budget submissions. Let's look forward to another strong year.
