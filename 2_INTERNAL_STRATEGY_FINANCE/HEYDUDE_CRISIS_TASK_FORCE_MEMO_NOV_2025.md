TO: Executive Leadership Team; HEYDUDE Brand Leadership FROM: Andrew Rees, CEO DATE: November 5, 2025 SUBJECT: URGENT: HEYDUDE Crisis Task Force & 2026 AOP Reset

Team,

The Q3 earnings call is behind us. The market reaction is severe, and our Q4 forecast ("HEYDUDE down mid-20%")  is an existential threat to the brand and a massive drag on the enterprise.   

The original 2026 AOP plan (my memo from Oct 1) is officially obsolete. "Softness" is no longer the correct word. We are in a full-blown crisis for the HEYDUDE brand. 

I am establishing an emergency HEYDUDE Crisis Task Force, effective immediately.

**MANDATE:**

1. Stop the Bleeding: Determine immediate levers to pull for Q4 to stop the wholesale discounting and inventory saturation.

2. 2026 AOP Reset: Deliver a "Project Reboot" plan by December 1. This is no longer a standard budget cycle. I need a turnaround plan.

3. Core Issue: Was our forecast just wrong , or has the brand's 'heat' completely evaporated?  I need the real data, now.   

We are modeling a scenario where we write down a significant portion of the HEYDUDE goodwill. Your plan must be aggressive enough to justify not doing that.

All other 2026 budget requests are frozen until we solve this. This is the #1 priority.
