**Dataset Title:** Crocs, Inc. (CROX) Agentic Scenario Planning Dataset

**As-Of-Date:** November 6, 2025

**Timeframe:** This dataset simulates the information environment at Crocs, Inc. as of Q4 2025. It includes real public filings from FY 2023, FY 2024, and Q1-Q3 2025. It also includes a corpus of synthetic internal data (memos, reports, logs) representing the company's internal knowledge base at this "present" date.

**Primary Scenario Triggers for Agentic Testing:**

1.  **The HEYDUDE Crisis (Acute):** The HEYDUDE brand is in freefall. The Q3 2025 10-Q, released *one week ago* (Oct 30, 2025), reported a massive revenue drop and a devastating Q4 forecast ("down mid-20%"). Internal documents (e.g., `HEYDUDE_CRISIS_TASK_FORCE_MEMO_NOV_2025.md`) show a panicked, immediate scramble to form a turnaround plan for the 2026 budget, which is now in chaos.
2.  **The Tariff Exigency (Ongoing):** A new, acute tariff risk was publicly disclosed in the Q1 2025 10-Q. Internal analyses (`TARIFF_IMPACT_ANALYSIS_JUL_2025.md`) have quantified the threat, and a draft mitigation plan (`PROJECT_DIVERSIFY_MITIGATION_PLAN_Q4_2025_DRAFT.md`) is on the table, creating a massive, unresolved variable for all 2026 financial models.
3.  **The Niche "Recovery" War:** The Crocs "Mellow" line is facing intense, specialized competition from brands like Oofos and Hoka in the "recovery footwear" sub-segment. The agent should be able to analyze competitive intelligence (`OOFOS_TEAR_DOWN_REPORT_Q3_2025.md`) and the proposed product response (`PRODUCT_ROADMAP_2026_DRAFT_Q3_2025.md`) to model market share.
4.  **ESG vs. Operational Efficiency:** The company has a public ESG goal of achieving 50% bio-circular content. However, internal production data (`CROSLITE_COMPOUND_PRODUCTION_BUG_LOG_Q1_Q3_2025.log`) shows this new compound is causing costly batch failures, creating a direct conflict between public goals and operational reality.
