## Slide 3: Modeling the Financial "Bomb" (FY2026 Projection)

*This model applies the new tariff rates⁵ to our planned 2026 production volume.*

| Country of Origin | % of Production | Old Tariff (Avg.) | New Tariff | Landed COGS Impact (FY2026) |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| China | 30% | 20% | 145% | -$310 Million |
| Vietnam | 40% | 15% | 46% | -$180 Million |
| Indonesia | 15% | 10% | 32% | -$55 Million |
| **Total** | | | | **-$545 Million** |

## Slide 4: Unmitigated Scenario

### A 1,200 Basis Point Margin Erosion

An unmitigated impact of **-$545M** on COGS would effectively wipe out our entire operating income, violating all debt covenants.

**This is the single greatest non-brand threat to the business.**
