# DRAFT: Project Diversify (Tariff Mitigation Plan for 2026 AOP)

**Subject:** DRAFT: Project Diversify (Tariff Mitigation Plan for 2026 AOP)  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

---

## 1. Objective

Mitigate the **$545M COGS impact** identified in the July `TARIFF_IMPACT_ANALYSIS`. Our 2026 AOP goal is to mitigate **$300M (55%)** of this impact.

## 2. Immediate Action (Q1-Q2 2026)

### China → Indonesia: Shift Production

- **Action:** Shift 15% of China volume (Croslite™ injection molding) to existing Indonesian partners
- **Rationale:** Indonesia's tariff hike (32%) is less severe than China's (145%)
- **Cost:** $15M in tooling

### Price Increases

- **Action:** Targeted 5% MSRP increase on non-core Crocs styles (Hiker, specific sandals)
- **Rationale:** Pass cost to consumer
- **Est. Revenue / Mitigated COGS:** +$40M
- **Risk:** Consumer price sensitivity

## 3. Mid-Term Action (Q2-Q4 2026)

### New Partner Vetting - Mexico

- **Action:** Accelerate vetting of two new manufacturing partners in Guadalajara, Mexico, for the NA market
- **Rationale:** Qualifies for USMCA preference (0% tariff)
- **CapEx:** $80M (Must be approved in 2026 AOP)
- **Risk:** High (quality control, ramp-up time)

### Vietnam → India: Shift Production

- **Action:** Shift 10% of Vietnam production to partners in India
- **Rationale:** India's tariff (26%) is lower than Vietnam's (46%)
- **Cost:** $10M

---

## 4. 2026 Mitigation Goal (Proposed)

**Total Mitigation:**  
(Indonesia Shift + Price Hikes + Mexico Ramp-up + India Shift) = **$300M**

**Remaining Unmitigated Impact (2026):** **$245M**  
*(To be absorbed by cost-cutting and margin)*
