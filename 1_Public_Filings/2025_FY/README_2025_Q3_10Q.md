**Filing Date:** c. October 30, 2025  

**MD&A Summary:** This is a disastrous quarter, especially for HEYDUDE. Consolidated revenue is down 6.2%.   

- Crocs Brand: Down 2.5%. This is a new, worrying sign, as the core brand is now showing weakness. The decline is led by North America (down 8.8%), while International markets remain a bright spot (up 5.8%).   

- HEYDUDE Brand: Revenue plummets. The brand recorded only $160 million in revenue. Outlook (The "Crisis Trigger") : Full-year 2025 outlook is slashed. Management now expects Q4 revenues to be "down approximately 8%", driven by the HEYDUDE brand being "down mid-20% approximately". Risk Factors: The filing states "no material changes" from the 2024 10-K, other than the tariff risk previously disclosed.
