**Filing Date:** c. February 13, 2025  MD&A Summary : Full-year 2024 revenues are reported at $4.1 billion, a 4% increase over 2023. This consolidated number masks the underlying problem: Crocs Brand revenues increased 8.8%, while the HEYDUDE brand (as forecast in Q3 ) decreased. The company highlights a strong adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and significant capital allocation: $323 million in debt repayment and $551 million in share repurchases. Risk Factors : The risk list is updated to reflect the new reality.   

- **HEYDUDE Risk:** The risk from the 2023 10-K  is now more acute. Management elevates the risk of "inability to accurately forecast consumer demand" , a direct nod to the HEYDUDE inventory issues.   

- **Competition:** The company explicitly names "significant competition" as a key risk.   

- **Supply Chain:** The standard risks of "dependence on third-party manufacturers located outside of the U.S." and "global supply chain constraints" and "inflationary pressure" remain critical.
